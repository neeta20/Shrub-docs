# FAQs

## Why is Shrub called Shrub?

A shrub is a hedge! The founders really liked how it was both memorable, and fun. It was love at first sight. Later down the road Bud was born. There is a whole story regarding his origin as well! But that's for another time. :)

## Why should I use Shrub?

Compared to traditional platforms Shrub offers many advantages. Users maintain control of their keys \(and thus their money\) and interactions with the platform are governed by code in smart contracts that cannot be arbitrarily changed.

Shrub cuts out the middle man, so fees can be very low \(especially compared to the 9.5% of options portfolio value that Robinhood takes from their users - $197.9M in revenue on $2B in assets in Q1-2021\). On the Shrub platform, all of the value stays with the users.

Robinhood enabled options trading for retail in the Web2 world and collected their fee for being the aggregator. In the Web3 world, Shrub enables cryptocurrency options trading for retail, and the community owns the platform.

## Why does Shrub use an order book rather than an AMM?

Shrub wants sellers to have full control over the price/strike/expiry of what they are selling so that they can implement their specific strategies \(for instance: to get yield or buy-in at a cheaper price\), an AMM model does not allow this.

Furthermore, AMM option pools have to sell at a premium to provide yield for the liquidity pool, so under normal circumstances, the buyers are getting a bad deal.

On the other hand, if there is a known volatility event upcoming such as:

* Protocol Upgrade
* Major government ruling - El Salvador accepting BTC
* Elon Musk on SNL

then buyers can take advantage of the "dumb" seller pool and buy options for cheaper than the price should be with the known volatility event.

## Who is that green guy on the landing page?

That's Bud! Bud is a shrub and he is the mascot of Shrub Finance. Bud is on an adventure to learn more about the metaverse and the possibilities enabled by DeFi.


## Why does this project require the blockchain?

Shrub is a decentralized exchange focused on reducing friction for writing and buying crypto options. The blockchain as the collateral/settlement layer is essential to ensure fairness to users and composability with other DeFi projects.

## Will Shrub launch on other blockchains?

For the time being the Shrub team is entirely focused on launching on Polygon.

Shrub will continue to listen to users and evaluate blockchains that enable low-cost, high-security trading of options.
