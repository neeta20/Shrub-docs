# Why Polygon

### Reasoning

High gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain necessitate launching Shrub on a layer 2 blockchain to enable reasonably priced transactions and a decentralized order book. After a thorough analysis, the Polygon blockchain was selected.

### Features

* Ethereum compatibility and interoperability
* Security
* Thriving ecosystem
* Fast Transactions
* Low gas fee

### Tradeoffs

* Ethereum users must bridge funds to Polygon before using Shrub which adds a layer of complexity
