# Liquidity

One of the key requirements for the Shrub platform to be a success is sufficient liquidity. In order for users to be able to get utility out of the platform, it is important that the buy/sell spreads are not too high and that there is a reasonable amount of volume for the contracts that are traded. Shrub will do the following to ensure good liquidity.

### Restriction on number of option combinations

At launch, Shrub will have a limited set of parameters for the options available to trade. They will be focused at-the-money and with a limited set of expiry dates. This is to ensure that liquidity will be focused on those options. Once a strong enough liquidity base for these is achieved, additional options will open up.

Shrub will be listening for user feedback in regards to which options should be listed on the site and will follow what its users want.

### Incentives for market making

Users who place limit orders, especially orders at the top of the order book will be rewarded with incentives for contributing liquidity.

### Engagement with Market Makers

Shrub is seeking to work with market makers who can backstop the bid and ask prices for the various options to improve liquidity. Shrub is also happy to work with individual users who are interested in performing this market-making function.

### Smart Pools

Smart pools or Automatic Market Makers for options are on the Shrub roadmap. These smart pools will buy and sell options based on a predefined strategy and will provide a market for the other side of the trade.
