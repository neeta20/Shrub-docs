# Shrub Platform


Shrub.finance is a decentralized finance \(DeFi\) exchange for trading cryptocurrency options.

Shrub options are _**American Style**_, which means that they may be exercised at any time, as opposed to _European Style_ options which can only be exercised at expiry.

Shrub options are _**Physically Settled**_, which means that they are settled in the underlying asset of the option contract. For instance, if you exercised a CALL option with a strike of 1.00 USDC for MATIC, you would pay 1 USDC and receive 1 MATIC

Shrub makes use of a decentralized order book where users sign orders and emit them as events to the blockchain.

Because Shrub is order book-based, users have full flexibility in how to trade options as in a traditional platform. They may either buy or sell options at a price of their choosing or execute complex strategies such as spreads.

Shrub supports options for any pair of ERC-20 tokens, however, the decentralized app \(DApp\) will only show a curated selection of option combinations
